# Tal's Card Web

Tal's Card Web is a web application built using React, Redux, Joi, Hooks, MongoDB, and Material-UI (MUI). It provides users with a platform to create and manage their digital business cards. This README provides an overview of the application's features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

# Features

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and log in securely to access their personalized business card dashboard.
Create and Customize Business Cards: Users can design their digital business cards by adding their contact information, profile picture, social media links, and other relevant details.
Validation with Joi: The application utilizes the Joi library for validating user input, ensuring that the entered information meets the specified criteria.
Responsive Design: The web application is built with a responsive layout, enabling optimal viewing and interaction across different devices and screen sizes.
Material-UI Components: Tal's Card Web incorporates Material-UI (MUI) components and styling for a polished and intuitive user interface.
Data Persistence with MongoDB: User data and business card details are stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running locally or provide the appropriate connection details in the project's configuration files.
Install the required packages by running the command `npm install`
Start the development server:`npm start`
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

Note: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

Usage
Upon launching the application, you will be presented with the homepage. If you already have an account, click on the "Login" button to access your business card dashboard. Otherwise, click on "Sign Up" to create a new account.

Once logged in, you can proceed to create and customize your business card. Choose a template that suits your style and preferences, and fill in the necessary details such as your name, contact information, profile picture, and social media links.

Ensure that the entered information meets the validation criteria enforced by the application, which is powered by the Joi library. Any invalid input will be flagged and must be corrected before saving.

The application leverages Material-UI (MUI) components and styling to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The UI components such as buttons, forms, and cards follow MUI design principles.

You can update and modify your business card at any time by accessing the dashboard. Additionally, you can delete your card if needed.

Remember to log out when you are done using the application to ensure the security of your account.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
